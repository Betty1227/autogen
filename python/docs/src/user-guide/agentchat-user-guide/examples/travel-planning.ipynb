            "\n",
            "1.  **English Proficiency:**\n",
            "    *   **High Proficiency:** Hotels, guesthouses, travel agencies, most restaurants catering to tourists, souvenir shops in Thamel and major sites, and professional guides will have staff who speak good English.\n",
            "    *   **Moderate Proficiency:** Many taxi drivers, shopkeepers outside the main tourist areas, and younger, educated individuals will likely have some basic English.\n",
            "    *   **Limited Proficiency:** In very local eateries, smaller shops, or with older individuals, English might be very limited or non-existent.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Learn Basic Nepali Phrases:** Even a few words go a long way in showing respect and often elicit a warm response.\n",
            "    *   **Namaste/Namaskar:** (Nah-mah-stay / Nah-mas-kar) - The traditional greeting, used for hello, goodbye, and sometimes thank you.\n",
            "    *   **Dhanyabad:** (Dhan-ya-bad) - Thank you.\n",
            "    *   **Hajur:** (Ha-joor) - Yes (polite, used to acknowledge or agree).\n",
            "    *   **Ho:** (Ho) - Yes (informal).\n",
            "    *   **Chaina:** (Chai-na) - No.\n",
            "    *   **Kati ho?:** (Kah-tee ho?) - How much? (useful for shopping/taxis).\n",
            "    *   **Ramro chha:** (Ram-ro chha) - It's good/nice.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Utilize Translation Apps:**\n",
            "    *   Have a translation app like **Google Translate** downloaded on your phone, with the Nepali language pack downloaded for offline use. This is invaluable for communicating with those who speak little to no English, especially for specific requests or in less tourist-centric areas.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **For Transportation (Taxis/Ride-Sharing):**\n",
            "    *   **Taxis:** When hailing a taxi, it's best to show the driver the destination written in Nepali (your hotel can help with this) or show it on a map on your phone. Negotiate the fare *before* getting in, as meters are rarely used. Knowing \"Kati ho?\" is crucial.\n",
            "    *   **Ride-Sharing Apps (Pathao/InDrive):** Your plan rightly mentions these. These apps are excellent as they set the price upfront, reducing the need for negotiation and clearly show the destination on the driver's phone, minimizing language barriers for directions.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Visual Communication:**\n",
            "    *   Don't hesitate to point, use gestures, or show pictures of what you're looking for (e.g., a specific dish on a menu, an item to buy).\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Hiring Guides:**\n",
            "    *   For the UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Durbar Squares, Pashupatinath, Boudhanath, Swayambhunath), consider hiring a licensed local guide. They are fluent in English (and often other languages) and provide invaluable insights into the history, culture, and religious significance, far beyond what guidebooks offer. This completely bypasses any language issues within the sites themselves.\n",

            "7.  **Patience and Politeness:**\n",
            "    *   Always approach interactions with patience and a smile. Nepalis are generally very welcoming and helpful, and a polite demeanor will resolve most minor communication hiccups.\n",
            "\n",

They are fluent in English (and often other languages) and provide invaluable insights into the history, culture, and religious significance, far beyond what guidebooks offer. This completely bypasses any language issues within the sites themselves.\n",
